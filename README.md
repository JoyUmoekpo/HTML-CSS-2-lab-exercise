# HTML & CSS 2
Duplicate layouts using the HTML and CSS tools you've learned.

## Summary
In this lab exercise, you will re-create three different layouts using HTML and CSS.

## Instructions
### Basic Layouts
Please download the contents of this lab to see the images you need to recreate. Inside each layout’s folder you’ll find an **_index.html_**, **_index.css_**, and an image file. The goal is to get as close as possible to the given design. Use the given image as a reference.

Since there are so many ways you can create the layout with HTML and CSS, there will not be a guide. However, if you get stuck, there will be an included solution to help you.

As stated before, your code doesn’t need to match the solution exactly, but it should match the provided image as closely as possible.
